# Testing Custom Tools in TLDraw

## What Should Be Visible

After the latest changes, you should see:

### 1. Custom Tools in Toolbar

- **Section Tool** (S key) - Creates time-based planning sections
- **Activity Tool** (A key) - Creates detailed activity cards

### 2. Toolbar Location

The custom tools should appear in the bottom toolbar, after the default TLDraw tools:

- Select tool
- Hand tool
- Draw tool
- Eraser tool
- Line tool
- Text tool
- Note tool
- Image tool
- Shape tools
- **Section tool** ← Should appear here
- **Activity tool** ← Should appear here

### 3. Visual Indicators

- Tools should have a color icon (currently using "color" icon)
- Tools should show keyboard shortcuts (S, A)
- Selected tool should be highlighted
- Tools should be clickable

## How to Test

1. **Open the whiteboard** in your browser
2. **Look at the bottom toolbar** - you should see the Section and Activity tools
3. **Click on the Section tool** - it should become highlighted
4. **Click on the canvas** - it should create a section shape
5. **Click on the Activity tool** - it should become highlighted
6. **Click on the canvas** - it should create an activity shape
7. **Use keyboard shortcuts** - press 'S' to select Section tool, 'A' to select Activity tool

## Expected Behavior

### Section Tool

- Creates rectangular shapes with dashed borders
- Shows emoji, time, and title
- Color-coded background
- Resizable and movable

### Activity Tool

- Creates rectangular shapes with solid borders
- Shows title, description, venue, and vote count
- Color-coded background
- Resizable and movable

## Troubleshooting

If the tools don't appear:

1. **Check browser console** for any errors
2. **Verify imports** - make sure all TLDraw components are imported
3. **Check component registration** - tools should be passed to TLDraw component
4. **Verify toolbar override** - CustomToolbar should be set in components

## Implementation Details

The custom tools are implemented through:

1. **Tool Classes**: `SectionTool` and `ActivityTool` extend `BaseBoxShapeTool`
2. **Shape Utils**: `SectionShapeUtil` and `ActivityShapeUtil` handle rendering
3. **UI Overrides**: Tools are registered in the UI context
4. **Custom Toolbar**: Toolbar component renders the tools
5. **Component Registration**: Tools are passed to TLDraw component

This creates a complete integration where the tools appear in the toolbar, can be selected, and create the appropriate shapes on the canvas.
